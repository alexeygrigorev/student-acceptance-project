## Student Acceptance Prediction

In this project, we develop a model for predicting if a student will be admitted to college or not

This project is done as a part of [Project of the Week at DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md)

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahwiz/school-data
